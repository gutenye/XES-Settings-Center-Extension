Originally created by XES.\n\nv10: fix for older versions, i havent tested this on anything below 3.10, v9: minor cleanup, now has an icon for the main menu entry. \n\nSettings shortcuts : gnome-tweak-tool, dconf-editor, gconf-editor, gnome-session-properties, gnome-shell-extension-prefs, seahorse and nvidia-settings. You can add your own\n\nOriginal source : http://svn.xesnet.fr/gnomeextensions (3.8 replace Settings code credit IsacDaavid)\n\nCredit to @peaceseeker for updating this with a working repo, i do wish it could have been pushed to me but my blank repo was deleted as it was stale, i failed to push to git before going back to work around 1.5 years ago and i hadn't been active enough to notice anything other than emails(these things help people!)",
